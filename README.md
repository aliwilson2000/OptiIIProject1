# OptiIIProject1
This repository is a collection of Colab Files used in Optimization II Project 1

We are aware that our Website contains a lot of files and text. This GitHub is a centralized place for all of our code clearly labeled. 

**Note:** The two files appended with "DoItYourself" are templates to go with the Methodology page. These are merely if you want to play around with the code yourself. Our code that has been used to test multiple models is in the testing files. We targeted our website at people with little knowledge of the topic, and should they want to create a CNN/Transformer, these are the files for them.
